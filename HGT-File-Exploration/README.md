### HGT File Exploration

A file with the HGT file extension is a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Data file. 
HGT files contain digital elevation models, which are 3D pictures of a surface — usually a planet — obtained during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) by NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)

Under this folder, the following bullet points will be covered:
- **Using web crawling techniques to download SRTM data (with HGT file extension) from <https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/>**
- **Index the elevation given GPS coordinates and SRTM data**
- **Create elevation / terrain visualization**

The content in this folder is organized as follows:
- Input (sample data)
- Output
- Code
- README
