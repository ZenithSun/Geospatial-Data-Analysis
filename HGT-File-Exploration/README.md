### HGT File Exploration

A file with the HGT file extension is a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Data file. 
HGT files contain digital elevation models, which are 3D pictures of a surface — usually a planet — obtained during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) by NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)

Under this folder, the following bullet points will be covered:
- **Using web crawling techniques to download SRTM data (with HGT file extension) from <https://dds.cr.usgs.gov/>**
- **Index the elevation given GPS coordinates and SRTM data**
- **Create elevation / terrain visualization**

The content in this folder is organized as follows:
- Input (sample data)
- Output
- Code
- README

**Here is one example of elevation visualization output:**<br>

By visualizing the elevation data, terrain in specific region can be better reviewed and understood. This would generate potential business values in cases such as insurance property claim process etc. 

The red dot in the plot corresponds to the given GPS coordinates.
